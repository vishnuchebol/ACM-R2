# ACM-R2
I have learnt a lot in this project. I solved all the questions in python as i was not completely comfortable with C++ or JAVA yet. I started off with CSES problem set which was there in the resources. Then learnt a few concepts like SORTING,BINARY SEARCH, TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITIES as these were a must for competetive coding. Then i started solving problems from codeforces(number theory) with the difficulty ranging from 800-1000 (I am a beginner). Found them hard initially but kept trying and saw the solution only if i didnt get it withing 45 minutes. Then i went on to learn other concepts like PREFIX SUMS and TWO POINTERS and solved problems based on these concepts on codeforces. I gave a few contests hosted by coding club also.
Overall it was a nice learning experiance which helped me get a good idea about competetive coding.
